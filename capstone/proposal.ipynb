    "Airbnb, which is an online marketplace where people list, discover, and book accomodations around the world. It has collected various datapoints about users. This data about the usage patterns of its present user base can be utilized to predict patterns about its future users to provide them with customized suggestions to serve Airbnb's customers better. Airbnb had posted this on Kaggle as a Recruitment Challenge. Using user\n",
    "data effectively can help organizations increase metrics such as sales, user experience, customer retention and customer satisfaction. Machine Learning techniques can help organizations attain useful predictions using these data. The motivation for pursuing this project is to understand how to work on real world datasets and challenges that companies like Airbnb consider to be important and valuable for their companies and learn to provide similar value for organizations that I work with in the future."

    "\n",
    "By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data from [Airbnb New User Bookings](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings) dataset, the challenge is to predict the destination of choice for the users' first booking. This data includes demographics of users and their session data. The model will utilize these demographics and session data to make models that can predict the destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I plan to use Machine Learning Techniques to predict in which country a new user will make their first booking on Airbnb. This project will involve data cleaning, data exploration using visualizations, and testing various algorithms for classification for the same."

The `test_users` is similar to the previous file discussed but does not have our target variable and we have to use these to predict the destination and has 62096 rows. We have a good amount of data to work with to produce meaningful models.\n",

    "\n",
    "The solution will largely utilize the fact that similarites in user demographics is likely to be correlated to the choices made by the users on the platform. This will be helpful for us to test supervised learning models to predict the behavious of new users. I will use the first 15 columns of the `users data` as input to these models and the `country_destination` as the target. \n",

    "I will then test various models such as SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest etc. we have learned in this course along with techniques such Grid-SearchCV to optimize and other models such as XGBoost which are used effectively in competitive environments such Kaggle."
